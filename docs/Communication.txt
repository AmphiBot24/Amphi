Acoustic Communications
communication links are subject to large propagation delays


ROV Communications
ROVs are usually communicated with via a tethered link to the surface. If communication is lost, some underwater robotics will automatically return to the surface. Tetherless ROV are currently in development.

Optical Marine Communications
	Optical technologies for underwater communications have also been developed, typically using laser diodes or LEDs for LOS (line-of-sight) communication. Optical communication provides a much higher data rate and lower latency than acoustic communications, but range is limited.
