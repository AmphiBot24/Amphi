Speed control methods for a DC series motor can be classified as:

1. Armature Control Methods
2.Field Control Methods

cascade control

Types of encoder
1. Incremental encoder
	Incremental encoders generate pulses as the shaft rotates or moves linearly
2. Absolute encoder:
	Absolute encoders don't need reference 

1. Rotary Encoders
	Optical Rotary Encoders
	Magnetic Rotary Encoders

2. Linear Encoder

Why BLDC no Stepper

BLDC high speed and torque 
Controlled using closed loop feedback system
Less weight
higher efficiency

The rotational speed and position of stepper motors are controlled by open-loop command pulses, which do not require feedback circuit, but they suffer from out-of-step problems. 
Brushless DC motors require speed control for constant speed rotation, through feedback from speed sensors to control speed. Since the torque is proportional to the current, it is easy to control the torque of brushless DC motors.
